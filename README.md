## Setup
The Nuclear Segmentation Pipeline was developed using a windows batch script. The batch script is necessary as we used multiple frameworks, each utilizing different python environments.
Therefore, the python environments must be set using the requirement scripts provided. 
The following three environments have to be set: 1. DataGenerator 2. pix2pix image translation 3. U-net architecture + lasagne wrapper for the U-net architecture

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
